# IPAddressLogging

Dystopia does not include an option to log player IP addresses in the normal log files generated by SRCDS. This plugin was made to include player IP addresses in SRCDS logs, in such away that complies with this standard: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/...50._Connection. It should likely work in games other than Dystopia, although you may see duplicate log messages if whatever game you are using it for already supports the logging of IP addresses.

It also creates the following command that requires the "ban" admin flag to use:
```
cinfo <#userid|name>
```

When called it will produce a message containing the client ID, name, IP address, and Steam ID for each player targeted by the command. Ex:
```
] cinfo @all
Client ID: 1 Name: Bot04 IP Address: 127.0.0.1 Steam ID: BOT
Client ID: 2 Name: Bot05 IP Address: 127.0.0.1 Steam ID: BOT
Client ID: 3 Name: Bot06 IP Address: 127.0.0.1 Steam ID: BOT
] cinfo Bot04
Client ID: 1 Name: Bot04 IP Address: 127.0.0.1 Steam ID: BOT
```
